### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name's AndrÃ© and I'm a Fullstack Software Engineer and Artist. Since technology has always pushed art forward, it felt very natural for my background in Music Production to evolve and merge with coding so here I am ready to take on the world ðŸ˜¤ When I'm not coding or working on the next music project, you can find me gaming, pouring a shot of espresso (sometimes gin), or going to Target with my girlfriend. If you ever wanna reach out don't be a stranger!

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building an Instagram automation app<br>
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my current obsession, I have many!<br>
âš¡ Fun fact: There is a bar in Brooklyn called Jupiter Disco and I transcend to the stars every visit
