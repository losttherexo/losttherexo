### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name's AndrÃ© and I'm a Fullstack Software Engineer and Artist! Since technology has always pushed creativity forward, it was very natural for my background in Music Production to evolve and aggregate into coding so here I am ready to take on the world ðŸ˜¤ When I'm not coding or working on the next music project, you can find me gaming, pouring a shot of espresso (or sometimes gin), or going to Target with my girlfriend. If you ever wanna reach out don't be a stranger!

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building an Instagram automation app.
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my fervent love for The 1975 and how I believe they mastered pop songwriting.
ðŸ“« How to reach me: a.vargas252@icloud.com
âš¡ Fun fact: There is a bar in Brooklyn called Jupiter Disco and I transcend to the stars every visit.
